# BRIO Toy Assembly Datase (BRIO-TA)
## What is BRIO-TA dataset?  
BRIO-TA is the dataset about the scene of assembling toy model of a car and is designed to simulate operations in factory assembly. 
In contrast with the existing dataset, BRIO-TA consists of two types of scenarios: standaridized assembly processes and anomalous assembly processes.
The anomalies are further categorized into incorrect orders, omissions, and abnormal durations. A subject in a video is asked to do either a normal work or one of the three anomalies, and all video frames are manually annotated to 23 action classes.

**Contents of the dataset**  
- 75 videos of toy assembling scenes
  - 30 videos of the standaridized assembly process
  - 45 videos of the anomalous assembly processes  
- annotation files
  - frame-wise action label
  - starting and ending frame of the section which anomalous assemblies occurred


## Sample videos
**The standardized assembly process sequence**  



**The 3 types of anomalous assembly processes sequences**  




## Dataset License  
The datasets can ONLY be used for research in non-profit organization, and academic purposes.
Without the expressed permission of NEC corporation, any of the following will be **illegal**: redistribution (BRIO-TA dataset and its URL), generation of a new sequence from this dataset, and commercial usage of any of the dataset in any way or form, either partially or entirety


## How to get dataset
- We will fill the contents after the paper be published
